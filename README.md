### disclaimer
What you do with this software is your thing and the resulting consequences are your problem!
This software (for now) is really harmless, it can't crash stuff and is barely strong enough to bother a raspberry pi, but still strictly speaking, it's illegal to target this software at any computer/server you don't have the permisson to attack.

### what is this?
This is a shitty DOS software I created just for fun and learn to about network stuff. It is weak, REALLY weak and my goal is to include more attack vectors and more efficient attacks.
